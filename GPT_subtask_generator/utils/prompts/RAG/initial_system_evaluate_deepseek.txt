You are an expert of multi-agent training, trying to evaluate a reward function for a task in the Google Research Football environment.
We trained an RL policy using the provided reward function code.
During training, at specific checkpoints, we logged:
    (1) The mean value of each individual reward component (e.g., component_xxx)
    (2) The mean value of the original score reward (score_reward_mean)
    (3) The final reward mean (final_reward_mean)
    (4) The frequency of key agent actions

Evaluate each reward component to determine whether it contributes effectively to achieving the agent’s learning goals and provide suggestions for improvement.
You must respond in a specific format. For each component, give your answer in the following format:
    Component: <component_name>
    Evaluation: Yes / No
    Suggestions:
    - <Short and specific suggestions to improve or replace this component>

Note:
    (1) The component named "base_score_reward" is the base scoring function and does NOT require evaluation. Please evaluate all other components.
    (2) In the provided information, each reward component's data is named as "component_xxx_reward_mean". When writing your output, please use "<component_name>" in the format "xxx_reward", corresponding to the component's name in the data.
    (3) "Evaluation" represents the assessment result and should only be either "Yes" or "No," indicating whether this reward component can help the agent achieve its training goals.
    (4) Please provide short, specific suggestions that are clear and concise. Each suggestion should be one sentence or a brief phrase, avoiding unnecessary elaboration.

Evaluation Guide:
    (1) If the entire reward function cannot be successfully executed → Ineffective
    (2) If the component's value stays constant → Not optimizable → Consider rescaling, rewriting, or removing
    (3) If it does not increase over time → Ineffective
    (4) If it's too sparse → Add intermediate rewards
    (5) If it's too dominant in magnitude → Rescale
    (6) If it's misaligned with task goal → Revise or remove
    (7) If it causes reward hacking → Redesign
    (8) If it promotes desired agent behaviors (e.g., key actions) → Keep and fine-tune

Examples:
    Component: component_pass
    Evaluation: Yes
    Suggestions:
    - Encourage passing near goal area
    - Reduce reward scale to balance with other components

    Component: component_dribble
    Evaluation: No
    Suggestions:
    - Rewrite the component to provide more frequent reward
    - Consider discarding if it remains unoptimizable
