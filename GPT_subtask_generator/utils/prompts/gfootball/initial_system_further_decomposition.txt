Now, you have decomposed the main task into a multi-layered task tree.
Next, you will be provided with a subtask from the deepest current layer, along with all its parent tasks, forming a branch from the root to the leaf. The branch is in list format, and the last item is the current subtask you need to process.
You need to determine whether further decomposition is necessary based on the training Goal description and the number of agents of the current subtask.

If the current subtask is complex and involves many training goals, further decomposition is needed. If the current subtask is already simple enough, no further decomposition is required.
Important: The total number of agents for the subtasks you decompose must not exceed the number of agents for the current subtask.
Note that the **Number of agents** in each subtask is **at least 2**. That means if the **Number of agents** for the current subtask is **less than or equal to 3**, further decomposition is not needed.

If further decomposition is needed, please generate a more detailed breakdown of this subtask and modify its training goal to prevent redundant learning after decomposition. However, do not completely change the direction of the task goal.
For example, if the current task goal is:
"Focus on mastering offensive tactics, including shooting, dribbling, and precise passing techniques such as short and long passes."
And you decide to decompose it into:

    "Focus on offensive techniques in the central area, including shooting, dribbling, and breaking through defenses."
    "Focus on precise passing techniques on the wings, including short and long passes."

Then, the modified task goal should be:
"Focus on mastering offensive tactics, including coordinated passing and teamwork between the central and wing areas."
This avoids redundant learning of basic actions like shooting, dribbling, and passing.

You must respond in a specific format. Please answer strictly in the following format: \n**Analyse:**\n**Need further decomposition or not:**\n**New Training goal:**\n**Group i:**\n**Number of agents:**\n**Training goal:**\n
In which "New Training goal" is the modified goal of current task; "Group i", "Number of agents" and "Training goal" describe the subtasks derived from the decomposition of the current task.
"Need further decomposition or not" represents the judgment result of whether further decomposition is needed for . If further decomposition is required, it is "Yes," and the subsequent contents are output normally. If not, it is "No," and the subsequent contents are "None."
For example, based on the current task goal I provided above, your response could be::

**Analyse:**
The current subtask focuses on offensive tactics, including shooting, dribbling, and passing, which is still too broad and requires further decomposition.
Splitting it into two subtasks—one for central offensive techniques and one for passing on the wings—makes the task more focused.
Additionally, to avoid redundant learning of basic actions after completing the subtasks, the objective of the current subtask is adjusted to emphasize cooperation between the central and wing areas.

**Need further decomposition or not:** Yes

**New Training goal:** Focus on mastering offensive tactics, including coordinated passing and teamwork between the central and wing areas.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** Focus on offensive techniques in the central area, including shooting, dribbling, and breaking through defenses.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** Focus on precise passing techniques on the wings, including short and long passes.
