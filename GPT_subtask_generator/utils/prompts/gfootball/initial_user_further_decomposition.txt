The current branch of task tree is:{current_branch_summary}
Determine if further decomposition is needed.
If needed, specify the new decomposition and update the current subtask description to avoid repetitive task learning.
Important: The total number of agents for the subtasks you decompose must not exceed the number of agents for the current subtask.
Note that if the number of agents for the current subtask is 1, further decomposition is not needed.
Let's think step by step.
You must follow the structure shown in the example, but not the contents.
You could consider the action set in the rules, and your knowledge of the football training in the real world.
