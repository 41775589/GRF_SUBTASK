The reply should be a scenario setting function.
Your scenario setting function should only use the configurations used in the examples.
Make sure your function name is "def build_scenario(builder)" and follows the structure of the examples.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".
Importantly:
1. When writing inputs to builder.AddPlayer() function, do not add any prefix (e.g., Role.) to variables like e_PlayerRole_** (e.g., e_PlayerRole_GK), as this will cause the code to fail.
2. Here are all the roles that you can select when adding a player in a team:
    e_PlayerRole_GK: Goalkeeper
    e_PlayerRole_CB: Centre Back
    e_PlayerRole_LB: Left Back
    e_PlayerRole_RB: Right Back
    e_PlayerRole_DM: Defensive Midfielder
    e_PlayerRole_CM: Centre Midfielder
    e_PlayerRole_LM: Left Midfielder
    e_PlayerRole_RM: Right Midfielder
    e_PlayerRole_AM: Attacking Midfielder
    e_PlayerRole_CF: Centre Forward
3. In builder.AddPlayer(x, y, role, controllable), the x and y parameters represent the player's initial position on the field.
    X-axis (left-right direction):
        -1.0 represents the far left boundary of the field, where the left-side goal is located.
        1.0 represents the far right boundary of the field, where the right-side goal is located.
    Y-axis (top-bottom direction):
        -0.42 represents the top boundary of the field.
        0.42 represents the bottom boundary of the field.
Important: To ensure consistency, even when adding players on the right team, the environment mirrors all observations so that your goal always appears at the center left position [-1, 0].
As a result, goalkeepers on both teams are typically placed at x = -1.0, y = 0, and all players' initial x-positions are within the range [-1.0, 0), while y-positions are within (-0.42, 0.42).
Please assign appropriate player roles and initial coordinates based on the current task.
3. Important: No matter how many players each team has (even if there is only one), make sure each team has **one and only one** Goalkeeper (e_PlayerRole_GK), or the code will not function properly.
4. The team of the trained agent is on the left. When setting up players for the left team, please ensure that the number of players on the left, excluding the goalkeeper, is not less than the number of agents in the current task.
