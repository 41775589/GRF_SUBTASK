Hre is an example of the output，Don't just simply copy it in your output:
{reward_wrapper}
The explanation of this example is:

    This checkpoint reward provides a step-by-step reward mechanism for agents by detecting ball possession and position, encouraging them to gradually advance the ball toward the opponent's goal.
    Specifically, the field is divided into several checkpoint regions, with these regions defined based on the Euclidean distance between the ball and the opponent’s goal.
    When the agent's team possesses the ball and enters a new checkpoint region, it receives an additional reward.
    The reward mechanism works as follows:
    The ball’s position is checked, and if its distance to the opponent's goal is below a predefined threshold (indicating a new checkpoint region), the reward is triggered.
    Each checkpoint can only be rewarded once, with the total possible reward sum reaching up to +1.
    If the agent scores a goal without passing through all the checkpoints, the uncollected checkpoint rewards are granted at once to avoid penalizing agents for skipping checkpoints (for example, scoring from outside a checkpoint region).
    This mechanism encourages agents to move the ball more strategically rather than relying on long-range shots, while maintaining sparse rewards and a clear progression goal.
    The checkpoint rewards are only given once per episode.

When you write the code, it's useful to think step by step and give an explanation in the comment, like the example above.
