**Analyse:**
In a 5 vs 5 football game setting, the agents need to work as a team to effectively play the game. Therefore, dividing them into groups based on their roles and responsibilities on the field can lead to a more structured learning process.

**Group 1:**
**Number of agents:** 3
**Training goal:** Learn passing and team coordination.
Since passing and coordination are essential for team play in football, this group will focus on actions like Short Pass, High Pass, and Long Pass. These agents will learn to work together to pass the ball efficiently and create scoring opportunities for their team.

**Group 2:**
**Number of agents:** 2
**Training goal:** Learn individual skills and scoring.
Forwards in football are responsible for scoring goals and often require individual skills such as shooting, dribbling, and positioning. This group will focus on actions like Shot, Dribble, and other offensive moves to enhance their ability to score goals and contribute to the team's success.
