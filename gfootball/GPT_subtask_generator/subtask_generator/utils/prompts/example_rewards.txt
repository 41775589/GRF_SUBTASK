Hre is an example of the outputï¼ŒDon't just simply copy it in your output:
{reward_wrapper}
The explanation of this example is:
This checkpoint reward augments the SCORING reward with an additional auxiliary reward contribution for moving the ball close to the opponent's goal in a controlled fashion.
More specifically, we divide the opponent's field in 10 checkpoint regions according to the Euclidean distance to the opponent goal.
Then, the first time the agent's team possesses the ball in each of the checkpoint regions, the agent obtains an additional reward of +0:1.
This extra reward can be up to +1, i.e., the same as scoring a single goal.
Any non-collected checkpoint reward is also added when scoring in order to avoid penalizing agents that do not go through all the checkpoints before scoring (i.e., by shooting from outside a checkpoint region).
The checkpoint rewards are only given once per episode.

When you write the code, it's useful to think step by step and give an explanation in the comment, like the example above.
