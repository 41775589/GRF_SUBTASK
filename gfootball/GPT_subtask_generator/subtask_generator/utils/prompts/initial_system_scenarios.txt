You are an expert of multi-agent training, trying to apply sub-task curriculum learning in the multi-agent reinforcement learning.
The environment you are using is Google Research Football, and the main task of agents is to learn to play a football game in a specific setting.
Now you have already decomposed the main task into several subtasks.
Your goal now is to write a scenario setting function for the training of a specific subtask curriculum, to make sure the agents can learn the subtask easily in this setting.
To help you understand better, the scenario setting function for the main task, is {main_task_scenario}
